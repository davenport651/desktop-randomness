# Desktop Randomness
This repo contains a set of useful scripts for use with something that accepts text and file inputs (like xscreensaver or anything else that needs access to a single file to do something interesting).  

<b>returnText</b> script will pull 200 lines of text starting at a randomly selected line from a randomly selected file in the directory. By default, the dir variable is pointed at /home/$USER/Downloads/ClassicBooks/ (where I keep a collection of txt files downloaded from http://www.gutenberg.org/).  Change it to whatever folder you have that holds a lot of raw text files.

To enable returnText, open the Xscreensaver Preferences window, click Advanced tab, then click "Program" radio button under "Text Manipulation", then enter the path to returnText.sh.

<b>cyclePictures</b> will pick a new planet texture from the '$HOME/Pictures/Planets' directory and a desktop wallpaper from '$HOME/Pictures/ultrawide/' and execute the refresh command. To use with GLPlanet on xscreensaver, point the day and night planet texture in the GLPlanet Settings to the '$HOME/Pictures/glPlanet' file as generated by cyclePictures.sh

<b>randomMusic</b> will randomly pull an mp3 from $dir and play it with either gnome-mplayer or VLC. Fill the directory with random jingles and set to run on login for mild amusement.

<b>Pirate Cinema</b> contains a snippet that can be pasted into your local .xscreensaver file to add a VLC screen hack inspired by the [Pirate Cinema](http://thepiratecinema.com/online/) art project.
